AutomateTheCloud was launched in 2019 by David Singer with the goal of wrangling cats. And by wrangling, I mean publishing, and by cats, I mean the ideas and concepts I've come up with over the years regarding AWS Infrastructure, CI/CD Automation, Scripting, and whatever other random fun things I think fit around here.

### Demo Information

This is a Demo project to illustrate how to Deploy a static website (in this case, using Jekyll) to an S3 Bucket (while still keeping the bucket private), Frontended by CloudFront, and using Lambda Edge to provide "Pretty URL" support.
